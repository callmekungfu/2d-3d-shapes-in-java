# 2d-3d-shapes-in-java
A comprehensive example of polymorphism in Java

## Project Description
This project is created for a grade 12 computer science course in Unionville High School. It resembles a temporary database which allows users to create 2-dimensional/3-dimensional shapes through inputting crucial properties. The program then inserts all the data into a private database, in which properties are only accessable through the use of built in accessor and modifier methods.

### The Principal
To demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming learned in class.

### Standard Features
* Encapsulation of geometric shape properties, only accessable through methods
* Class level counting properties implemented
* High variable efficiency
* Default constructors for indecisive users
* A one of a kind geometry hierarchy implemented in `Shapes.java`
* Easy to use, foolproof command prompt interface

### Unique Features
* Robust input listener that prevents input human error
* Database status report
* Database records report
* One of a kind output tracker
* User setting and profile system
* Robust query system
* SAVE DATABASE INFORMATION ON HARD DRIVE!

## How to?
Here are some instruction to using this software
### Requirments
This program is developed on Java 8, however, running on any version later than 7 should be fine. The Yonglin Utility Package - `com.yonglinwang.util` is required for this program to function properly.
### Installation
Simply paste the src file into any IDE workspace to use the code, there are no project setup avaliable, only source code. The `Shapes.java` and `Shape.java` are the files.

## Supported Shapes
2-dimensional shapes (all 4 sided):
* Square
* Rectangle
* Rhombus
* Kite
* Parallelogram
* Isosceles Trapezoid

3-dimensional shapes (all 6 sided):
* Cube
* Square Based Prism
* Rectangular Prism
* Regular Pentagonal Pyramid

## Input, Output, Storage
This section describes the IO process of the database
### Input
This program accepts a wide range of inputs, here is a list of them -
+ Commands ([insert],[help],[publish])
+ Record property data
### Output
This program makes numerous outputs to improve user experience -
+ Instruction Prompts
+ Record Information
+ Database reporting
### Storage
+ The database in a unique binary format.
